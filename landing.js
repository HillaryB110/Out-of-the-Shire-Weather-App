//   fetch(api_url)
//     // this way of writing the api allows me to make it dynamic and put it what was searched for so that i can extract the information required

//     .then((response) => response.json())
//     // because what i initially recieve is still somehow not in json format

//     .then((json) => {});



// make the Explore word into a clickable thing 
//hyperlink the new page to the landing page
